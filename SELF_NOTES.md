# What the hell is this project?

You are doing some audio things I guess.

## What can you rememember?

You have some rust app that will listen to audio devices and then broadcast a websocket obj with all of these audio values or something.

## Why tho?

Make music pretty? I don't know. Some react frontend consumes those values and updates 3d stuff.

## Cool.

Yah.

## So now what?

Shrug emoji.

## How do I get this going again?

eh, turn ON the rust thing (`cargo run`) then turn on the frontend (`npm run dev`) from each dir

## Then what?

Look self, I have no idea. Leave me alone, I'm already onto some other bizzare sidequest now.

## Jeez, a bit touchy eh? What are you wasting time on these days?
